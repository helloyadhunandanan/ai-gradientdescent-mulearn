# 🎯 Cubic Equation Solver using SGD + ReLU

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Cubic Equation Solver** for equations in the form:

```
ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0
```

The solution is approached using **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** combined with the **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** activation function to minimize the loss and approximate the root(s) of the equation.
